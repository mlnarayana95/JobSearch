Project Statement: 

JobSearch is a way for people to search for jobs and also for recruiters, companies to post unlimited job ads. It also allows recruiters to set filters to filter candidates based on the skill, experience. Job Portal uses technology and in particular web-based resources for tasks involved with finding, attracting, assessing, interviewing and hiring
new personnel. 

TECHNICAL STACK:

1. Angular 8  vs React 16 

-- 2 Way Data binding enables synchronization to make more interactive applications 

-- Supports TagsComponent to add skills as tags to a job or a candidate

-- Supports Dependency Injection that helps create loosely coupled components. That enables you to replace dependencies without changing the class that uses them. It also reduces the risk that you have to change a class just because one of its dependencies changed. 

2. JAVA vs PYTHON 

-- Java Spring Boot + Spring Security OAuth 2.0 to create RESTful API's 

-- Why Spring Boot? 
   Spring Boot just decides on a set of default configured beans which you scan override if you want.

   For example if you include the spring boot starter pom for jpa, you'll get autoconfigured for you an in memory database, a hibernate entity manager, and a simple datasource. This is an example of an opinionated (Spring's opinion that it's a good starting point) default configuration that you can override.

3. Spring Data JPA 

4. Hybrid Data modeling using MySQL and NoSQL

5. Run a Docker-enabled application on an Amazon ECS cluster behind a load balancer with Monitoring
